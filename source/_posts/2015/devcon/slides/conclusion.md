## Conclusion

@@@

## Reusable as a **whole**

System included.

@@@

## **Isolated** services

No chance to mess up with *system packages*.

@@@

## **Composable** stacks

Legacy apps and modern ones.
Installable at all time. Now and in 5 years (hopefully).

(want to try out *Go*, *Node.js* or *Spark*?)

@@@

## Testable **systems**

Dependencies included.

@@@

## **Consistency**

What works **here** works **there**.
