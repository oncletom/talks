# Notes

Different degrees of open source: reporting, issuing, fixing, improving, contributing and managing. In any case: for a single effort, the quality tends to increase, so is its discoverability and your knowledge.

# Quotes

it is a sponge between your organisation and the outside
it helps to discover new related works, which enhances yours at a lower cost than producing it
it thus connect your work in
enforces separation of concerns (less tempted to do too much for a component/module)
it makes it more difficult to hide a debt (either technical, documentation or security): clarification of owners, process etc.

if you fear to lose your developers because they are more identifiable, care more about them: they will not leave because they will do open source elsewhere but because your company sucks at treating them properly.

> When they exist, technology cannot be retained in exclusive ways.
> A specialization advantage arises only if a supplier which incurs fixed costs can serve a number of different producers at only a small additional cost.
> Importantly, these spillovers can also occur across sectors, as our discussion of GPTs suggests. In his study of the US machine tool sector in the 19th century, Rosenberg (1976) noted that the various downstream industries using machine tools started up at different times. For instance, firearm manufacturing emerged earlier than sewing machines, typewriters or bicycles. The growth of the firearm industry spurred the development of metal-cutting and shaping machines. Bicycle production required metal-cutting operations that were very similar to those of the firearm industry (e.g. boring, drilling, milling, planing, grinding, polishing, etc.—see Rosenberg, 1976), and thus the bicycle industry could rely upon the suppliers of metal-cutting machines that were already serving the larger firearm industry. What the suppliers had learned in producing metal-cutting machines for the firearm producers did not have to be learned again to supply bicycles producers. The commonality in the learning process across the industries, or what Rosenberg called “technological convergence”, was critical for the transmission of growth, but required the intermediation of an upstream sector.

> Software companies have long realized the economic and strategic value of using and contributing code to external open source projects. But they're much slower to understand and apply the same open source methods of collaboration to their own projects internally

> In short, all of the same benefits that outside companies can get by being able to see the source code are available with internal open source.
> One of the major goals of this program is to increase the technology transfer from HP Labs to the rest of the company.
> Done correctly, internal open source allows a company to leverage the work of all of its employees, to eliminate duplicate work, and to encourage innovation.

> The BBC has traditionally been something of a fortress, a citadel; you have been either within it or outside. Hall is determined to change that. The corporation must and will become “porous”, he said. Instead of the portcullis being shut the BBC will, in the future, send its audiences out of the castle precincts and towards the work of other organisations whose values it shares.
> The BBC will, he said, share its resources and work with organisations outside, too: “If you’re paid for by everybody it’s your job to be porous. That doesn’t mean you lower standards – no, no, no. You are elitist about your standards, but you should be porous in terms of the people that you’re inviting in to share our space.”
